Theses two codes are Supplementary material for paper: 
"Inf-sup stable non-conforming finite elements on tetrahedra with second and third order accuracy"
by L. Balazi, G. Allaire, P. Jolivet, P. Omnes 

TestUnisolvenceVn1.py: Python's code for demonstrating the unisolvence of the finite element space V_2 and V_3 presented in Lemma 3.4.

DefineAllSigmaN2.py: Python's code for searching all the suitable basis. This script returns all the subspaces \Sigma_{n+2} of P_{n+2} that allows to complete the space P_{n+1}
